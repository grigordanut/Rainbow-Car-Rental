# Rainbow-Car-Rental
First-year project: Developed an HTML website project based on a taxi and car renting company that would allow the user to book a taxi online, and rent a car online with the possibility of collecting the car from a different location in Dublin and returning the car in the same or a different location than the car was collected.
Technologies used: HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
